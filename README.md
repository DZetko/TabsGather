# TabsGather
**TabsGather** is a simple but powerful Chrome extension that allows you to save all your opened tabs (in all Chrome windows) as bookmarks in an easy manner.

## Usage
Just click the icon next to your URL bar. Your tabs are saved to a folder (with the current date as it's name) located in Other Bookmarks --> TabsGather. It is especially helpful when you are in a hurry, but want to continue your work later.
